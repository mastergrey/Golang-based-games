# Golang-based-games
A collection of Golang-based games designed to teach core game development concepts through clean, readable implementations.

#pokercalculator

A terminal-based Texas Hold’em poker odds calculator written in Golang that uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate win and tie probabilities from known hole cards and partial or complete community boards. The project is learning-focused, prioritizing clear data modeling, explicit hand evaluation logic, and readable Go code over heavy optimization, making it suitable for understanding how poker engines and probabilistic game simulations are built.
